# UFOs

## Overview ##

Dana, a data journalist, has been given the opportunity to write about her hometown McMinnville, OR. As McMinnville is famous for its UFO sightings, Dana has chosen to writer about this. She decided that she wanted to use data held in an extensive JavaScript file to create a filterable table. The filtered data and her findings to be held in an HTML webpage. Dana needed for the webpage to be able to search the following criteria regarding the sightings: Date, in 2010, of the sighting, city of the sighting, state of sighting, country of sighting and the shape. Each search parameter functions independently of any other parameter, but multiple parameters can be entered

## Results ##

Use and navigation of the website is simple. Using a web browser, the user would input the HTML address and would navigate to the site below. The site homepage is defaulted to show a number of sightings:

The user is then able to navigate to their desired search parameter results, for example, if you wanted el cajon as a city, you would simply enter ‘el cajon’, in lowercase fashion, as shown in the prefilled examples, then simply click out of the search field and all instances of El Cajon UFO sightings that are contained within the JS file will populate:

If the user wanted to filter by date and city, for example, they would be able to input those 2 parameters:

The user may also search by shape:

Then, when all fields are cleared, we reach the beginning page:

## Summary ##

The main drawback of this page is you are not aware of just how much you can search, so if you would like to search more data outside of the first 13 days of January of 2010, you will not retrieve any info. This is not made very apparent. The website also still looks to be in early stages of development, which is by design, but in the real world, we would want it to be more polished. Furthermore, I would also recommend that data be added to offer a more optimal experience. This website is a great start for Dana, though!
